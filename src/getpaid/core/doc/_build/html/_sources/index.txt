   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to getpaid.core's documentation!
========================================

The ``getpaid.core`` package stands at the center of the GetPaid
e-commerce solution, which currently supports both a shopping cart and a
check-out wizard for the Plone content management system.  The workflows
and interfaces defined here in the core establish the concepts which all
GetPaid components, packages, and plug-ins use to integrate with one
another.

At the moment, only one developer's guide exists yet: a draft that
explains how to write a payment processor.  Enjoy!
