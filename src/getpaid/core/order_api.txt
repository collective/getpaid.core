GetPaid Core Order API
==============

Basic workflow
--------------

Let's first create an Order object to work with:

   >>> from getpaid.core.order import Order
   >>> testorder = Order()
   
Now we'll test the order workflow...

Before we fire the 'create' transition we don't have a workflow states
for finance and fulfillment

   >>> state = testorder.fulfillment_state
   >>> print state
   None

   >>> state = testorder.finance_state
   >>> print state
   None

Firing the 'create' transition in the finance workflow should put us 
in the REVIEWING state
 
   >>> testorder.finance_workflow.fireTransition('create')
   >>> state = testorder.finance_state
   >>> print state
   REVIEWING
   
Firing the 'create' transition in the fulfillment workflow should put us 
in the REVIEWING state
 
   >>> testorder.fulfillment_workflow.fireTransition('create')
   >>> state = testorder.fulfillment_state
   >>> print state
